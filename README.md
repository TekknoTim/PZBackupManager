# Project Zomboid Backup Manager
<br/>

## Important Disclaimer <br/>
**<ins>I'm not a programmer and I made both programs just for fun. <br/>
I began with not much knowledge about programming or designing software! <br/>
Please consider, that YOU ARE USING BOTH PROGRAMS AT YOUR OWN RISK! <br/>
Therefore, I am not liable for any damage to your savesgames or similar.</ins>** <br/>
<br/>

## Introduction <br/>
### What is this? <br/>
This program is used to create backups of your savegame folders in the videogame [Project Zomboid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid/), managing & <br/>
restoring them more comfortable, than copy/pasting folders folders by hand. This allows you to save/backup the game at any time. <br/>
If you than die or make a mistake you can't live with, you can just restore an old backup save & try again. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Features
### 1. - Display, rename, manage & restore your created backups of multiple savegames. <br/>

### 2. - A (Hopefully) Easy2Use GUI. <br/>

### 3. - No installation required. <br/>
**Just unzip the downloaded file to a location of your choice & run the <ins> ZomboidBackupManager.exe** </ins> <br/>

### 4. - Displays your savegames automaticaly. <br/>
**Just select the one you are playing right now.** <br/>

### 5. - Change Backup Data Directory. <br/>
**Select any folder on your pc, to be used as the base backup savelocation.** <br/>

###  6. - Project Zomboid Connection. <br/>
**With the workshop mod subscribed & enabled,** (Steam Workshop Mod @ [ Steam ](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3453009151)) <br/>
you are able to establish some kind of connection between the game & the manager app. <br/>
That will allow you to minimize the app or add it as an icon to your taskbar, <br/>
while playing project zomboid. The manager app then will do backups silently in the background. <br/>

### 7. - Auto Delete Backups <br/>
Keeps an constant amount of backups, <br/>
by auto-deleting the oldest backup after each new backup being made, <br/>
after reaching an adjustable threshold. <br/>

### 8. - Auto Clean Backup Directory <br/>
Automatically finds (and deletes) unlisted & <br/>
obsolete backup data of backups made in the past for savegames, <br/>
that are currently not existing anymore. <br/>

<br/>
