  restore process. (Just go to back to the main menu.)

   You can either minimize the window now, put it on a second screen or similar.

6. To make sure everything is working, you can use the test button. - [Optional]
  (A Messagebox should appier shortly after pressing.)
7. To use it, load your game, make sure your game isn't paused & you're not
